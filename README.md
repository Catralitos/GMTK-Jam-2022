# GMTK Jam 2022

Rigged Roll is a top-down shooter where you play as a space cowboy, who makes his money gambling! He is the best dice cheat in the whole galaxy. No one manipulates dice like him.

He has special dice that when they land on his enemies, give him special abilities temporarily, and he can even manipulate the dice to change the odds in his favor.

In fact, he uses his dice so much, that it could be considered abuse, to the point The Tesseracts, the ultimate cubes, jump in from another dimension to get revenge for their brethren.

Now it's time to show them that you are the greatest gunslinger and you can survive their hoards!



HOW TO PLAY
To play, use WASD to move, your mouse to aim, and the left mouse button to fire.

You are able to shoot your dice, and when they hit enemies, depending on the side they roll, you will get a buff for your next bullet fired. There are 6 buffs:

Increased move speed for a short while
Decrease fire cooldown
Increase bullet damage
Shoot 2 extra bullets
Increase bullet knockback
Make bullet piercing
Enemies drop experience points, filling up the blue bar. For each level-up you earn, a level-up screen will pop up where you need to choose from one of 3 random sides of the dice to increase or decrease its chance of rolling. But the sum of the odds of the dice is always 100%, so by changing one, you will affect the others. Optimize to your liking or try to keep it balanced!

After every 5 waves that are completed, a skill tree will open where you can spend points on permanent abilities. Try to make it as far as you can!
